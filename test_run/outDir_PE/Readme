Explanation of columns in 'stat.databaseName.txt' files:
Column 1: Ref sequence name
Column 2: % of nucleotides that map to Ref sequence, compared to number of nucleotides that mapped to one paticular database
Column 3: Depth or X,  i.e. total number of nucleotides mapped to Ref sequence divided with length of Ref sequence
Column 4: Total number of nucleotides mapped to Ref sequence
Column 5: Coverage, fraction of Ref sequence that is covered
Column 6: Number of unique positions in Ref sequence that is covered
Column 7: Size of Ref sequence
Column 8: % of reads that map to Ref sequence, compared to number of reads that mapped to one paticular database
Column 9: Total number of reads mapped to Ref sequence
Column 10: Description of Ref sequence

A special file is 'abundance.databases.txt' which shows read aboundance for all databases
Percentages are calculated based on reads available after removing those that map to PhiX (notPhiX). notPhiX count is set
Unmapped reads is calculated only on runs in Chainmode.

Files named *uniq* only include uniquely mapped reads i.e. sam tags AS > XS meaning there is only one best hit. Only a criteria for one of the paired reads
AS is the alignment-score and AX is the second best alignment score for one paticular read mapping to a reference sequence database

All files are combined in two excel workbooks named sample.xlsx and sample.uniq.xlsx which include headers and figures
